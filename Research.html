            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              The purpose of United Way’s ALICE (Asset Limited,
              Income-Constrained, Employed) Initiative is to communicate and
              address concerns working-class American families have in affording
              necessities. Historically, since the War on Poverty, the United
              States government has set standards that determine the number and
              proportion of people in poverty and who public welfare programs
              should appropriately target (United Way, 2019). Changes in the
              life of American families and rising cost of living begets
              expansion and changes in public assistance and social programs. As
              a result, the ALICE project provides an alternative methodology to
              identifying people in poverty; the number and proportion of people
              who are considered ALICE is determined based on the household
              survivability budget, then rounded to the nearest American
              Community Survey income bracket. Families who do not make enough
              income above a certain threshold are considered ALICE. ALICE is
              becoming increasingly recognized and United Way provides programs
              that increasingly meet the struggles and needs of these working
              families. In terms of influencing policy focused on social
              services, there is plenty of research that assess opportunity in
              geography; while previous research has visualized opportunity in
              various American metropolitan areas and regions, there is limited
              research on the way structural entities in the form of
              technological companies impact opportunity or opportunity examined
              at more granular levels. Drawing from a compilation of data, the
              study will attempt to address these questions: how are
              technological companies visualized and influence allocation of
              opportunity? How is opportunity conceptualized in various US
              locations at the neighbourhood-level, and in the presence of
              technological companies? Answering that question is contingent on
              three different requirements: a) visualize opportunity in these
              locations at the block-group level, b) identify ‘technological
              companies’ that influence the allocation of opportunities, and c)
              identify patterns or implications after these two concepts of
              opportunity are juxtaposed. For the purposes of this research, the
              two concepts that will be referred to are: opportunity mapping and
              geography of opportunity. The former is defined as: ‘a way to
              conceptualize and visualize the varying levels of access to the
              opportunities which exist throughout states and regions” (Reece et
              al. 2010, p. 3) while the latter is defined as: “where people live
              impacts their access to opportunity” (Green, 2015, p. 718).
              Answering that question will involve a series of qualitative
              analysis of various variables while drawing from previous
              research. In summary, this study will provide a methodology which
              will aid in informing community organizations like United Way
              about how communities are impacted and influence both
              philanthropic and community action.<br /><br>Acknowledgement:<br> Emma Slager, Assistant Professor <br>
