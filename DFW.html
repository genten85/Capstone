    <div class="description"><h1>Dallas Texas</h1><br>The contrast among the opportunity map, ALICE families map, and populations of color map presents some fascinating
    findings. High opportunity block groups are in the City Centre District, then north into North Dallas and Addison and
    dispersed towards Reinhardt and Oldham. While there is a mix of low-mid opportunity block groups in the southwest and
    southeast area, there is a noticeable consolidation of low-opportunity ones, like Sargent and Fruitdale. High ALICE
    population block groups are located interestingly outside of Dallas’s City Centre District in addition to a) outer
    western parts, b) outer eastern parts, and c) the southern part of the city district. Where there are high ALICE
    population block groups, even areas with high populations of color, there are low opportunities. The technological
    office clusters seem to differentiate the distribution of opportunities, ALICE populations, and populations of color for
    this city. Tate’s case study of Fort Worth where his drive south through North Central Expressway down the Telecom
    Corridor is a stark contrast to his drive towards Martin Luther King Dr. Blvd further
    corroborates this finding. It would suggest despite extending the DART rail lines to Buckner and Ledbetter that the
    amenities and opportunities are still abundant in the City Centre District and North Dallas while communities in South
    Dallas remain somewhat deprived. DART rail provides great movement for people within the condensed tech clusters and
    extends as far north as Denton and as westward towards DFW Airport and further towards Fort Worth.<br><br>
    
    Block groups are influenced in a way where there appears to be a northern-southern regional split in terms of
    opportunities available. There is strong polarization in terms of median income and education attainment, in which high
    opportunity levels are founded in block groups north of Dallas’s city center district and low opportunity levels were
    found south from there. There is lesser polarization among the same two regions in terms of vehicle ownership and
    commute time, based on the amount of moderate opportunity block groups. In addition to previously mentioned
    opportunities, education and proximity to community resources and bus stops were moderate-high in the city’s central
    district. Despite the presence of moderate-opportunity block groups and a neutralized effect from high and
    low-opportunity block groups, certain opportunities influence a geographical split within Dallas.<br><br>
    <h1>Fort Worth Texas</h1><br>
    High opportunity block groups are located near certain amenities and in particular, the western and northwest part of
    the city—around the Chisholm Trail Pkwy and near the NAS Joint Reserve Base—as opposed to the south eastern parts where
    there are low opportunity block groups. While in general, high ALICE population block groups are dispersed around Fort
    Worth, there are others, that also have high populations of color, located east of 35W Southbound and south of Tom
    Landry Hwy. Some of the block groups with high populations of color are located long the path of the Trinity Railway
    Express, starting at Fort Worth Central Station. Though Fort Worth’s technology offices are presumably dispersed, many
    of the offices are located in that central, northwest region; they exist around 30 West Fwy and the Chisholm Trail Pkwy.
    It is important to stress that not all of the technology offices might be represented in this study.<br><br>
    
    Block groups around the Chisholm Trail Pkwy is notable for highest opportunity levels in the following opportunities:
    vehicle ownership, education attainment, proximity to toxic release sites, and median income. Median income, education,
    and proximity to toxic release sites influence moderate-high level opportunities in the western region, with exception
    to very few block groups. The southeast region has the lowest levels in terms of education attainment, education, and
    median income. While the northern region experienced low levels of opportunity in vehicle ownership, commute time, and
    proximity to toxic release site, it appears the effect is counteracted based on other measured opportunity factors like
    education. Like Dallas, proximity to bus stops and community resources were highest in the center of the city; the
    effect is lesser in the outskirts.<br>
