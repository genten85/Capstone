              <div class="description"><h1>Seattle Washington</h1><br>Most of the high opportunity block groups are located around Northern Admiral, Southlake Union, Queen Anne, Capitol
              Hill, and the University District. Low opportunities are found around the Highland Park, Georgetown, and South Seattle
              area. The low opportunity areas in the southern part of the city has a greater presence of ALICE families and
              populations of color. More populations of color can be found in Beacon Hill, Pioneer Square, and Industrial District.
              Most of the areas with the least populations of color are located in the outer edges of the city limits, Northern
              Admiral, and North Seattle. While there is high ALICE populations in the southern part of the city, there are still high
              ALICE population block groups located in other parts, co-occurring with block group counterparts that have low amounts;
              some of those areas include the Northgate and Green Lake area. Areas with the low populations of color and ALICE
              families are found in the Washington Park and Madrona area. It is probable given these observations that while low ALICE
              population block groups reside in the technology office clusters, others are dispersed into the more suburban areas,
              especially where opportunities are abundant. It is important to take notice that the Link Light Rail is providing
              movement of people among the low-opportunity areas—Northgate and South Beacon Hill—located in outer parts of the city
              limits and people located in high-opportunity block groups or the technology office clusters.<br><br>
              
              Among opportunity factors, it appears education, education attainment, proximity to toxic release sites, and commute
              time were the lowest among block groups within the White Center and South Seattle area. Vehicle ownership, education
              attainment, and education were the highest among block groups in Ballard and northern parts of the city. There were many
              factors—education attainment, median income, and commute time—that influenced level of opportunity in places like
              Capitol Hill and Madrona. Despite these notable observations, it is plausible the block groups of other areas
              experienced moderate levels of opportunity—vehicle ownership, proximity to community resources, education, and education
              attainment—and slight up-ticks on others.<br>
