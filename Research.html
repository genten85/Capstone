            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
              The purpose of United Way’s ALICE (Asset Limited,
              Income-Constrained, Employed) Initiative is to communicate and
              address concerns working-class American families have in affording
              necessities. Historically, since the War on Poverty, the United
              States government has set standards that determine the number and
              proportion of people in poverty and who public welfare programs
              should appropriately target (United Way, 2019). Changes in the
              life of American families and rising cost of living begets
              expansion and changes in public assistance and social programs. In
              addition, the vagueness associated with the term poverty, the
              negative connotation that it is given, and the multiple usages of
              the federal poverty line suggests inadequacies in using these
              federal standards to assess financial hardship (United Way, 2019).
              As a result, the ALICE project provides an alternative methodology
              to identifying people in poverty; the number and proportion of
              people who are considered ALICE is determined based on the
              household survivability budget, then rounded to the nearest
              American Community Survey income bracket. Families who do not make
              enough income above a certain threshold are considered ALICE.
              ALICE is becoming increasingly recognized and United Way provides
              programs that increasingly meet the struggles and needs of these
              working families. In terms of influencing social services policy,
              there is research that assess opportunity in geography; while
              previous research has visualized opportunity in various American
              metropolitan areas, there is limited research on the way
              structural entities in the form of technological companies impact
              a community’s access to opportunities, especially when examined at
              more granular levels. Understanding where opportunities are and
              how opportunities are allocated geographically helps policy makers
              determine what policies are effective in allocating resources for
              impoverished communities. Drawing from a compilation of data, the
              study will attempt to address this question: how are technological
              companies visualized and influence allocation of opportunity in US
              metropolitan areas at the neighbourhood level? Answering that
              question is contingent on three different requirements: a)
              visualize opportunity in these locations at the block group level,
              b) identify ‘technological companies’ that influence the
              allocation of opportunities, and c) identify patterns or
              implications after these two concepts of opportunity are
              juxtaposed. For the purposes of this research, the two concepts
              that will be referred to are: opportunity mapping and geography of
              opportunity. The former is defined as: ‘a way to conceptualize and
              visualize the varying levels of access to the opportunities which
              exist throughout states and regions” (Reece et al. 2010, p. 3)
              while the latter is defined as: “where people live impacts their
              access to opportunity” (Green, 2015, p. 718). A qualitative
              analysis will be conducted of various factors, while drawing from
              previous research, using data based on a set of metropolitan
              areas. The output will inform viewers about the study’s
              methodology and results and visualize the geographic information
              in a way that aids in answering the research question. In summary,
              this study will provide a methodology which will aid in informing
              community organizations like United Way about how communities are
              impacted and influence both philanthropic and community action.<br /><br />Acknowledgement:<br />
