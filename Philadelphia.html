              <div class="description"><h1>Philadelphia Pennsylvania</h1><br>Most of the high opportunity block groups are in the city—Rittenhouse Square, Washington Square West, and Chinatown—and
              then dispersed in other areas of the city boundaries—Overbrook, Northeast Philadelphia, and Chestnut Hill. The low
              opportunity areas—Feltonville, Juniata, Kensington, and Bridesburg—not only have large ALICE populations and populations
              of color. There is interestingly a consolidation in the block groups among high populations of color and low populations
              of color into larger boundaries; for instance, high opportunity block groups with the lowest populations of color are
              located around the Northeast Airport and are distinguished through the Chestnut Hill West SEPTA rail segment and some
              part of the Trenton SEPTA rail segment that separates Bridesburg. Though there is a large amount of ALICE families north
              from the city and in the suburban areas, they co-occur with low ALICE population block groups. Interestingly enough, low
              ALICE population block groups are located near certain amenities; while some of those block groups are located near the
              Delaware River, Schuylkill, and across Chestnut St. down to the Delaware River, they are located along the Pennypack and
              Wissahickon Creeks. In the technology office clusters, there are block groups with low populations of color in the city
              and industrial areas (though the outer skirts of these clusters, the Grays Ferry and Point Breeze areas, are
              distinguished with block groups with high populations of color) and areas with mix of high and low ALICE populations
              distinguished with a set of low ALICE population block groups that run across Chestnut St. Chestnut St. is recognized
              not only for high amenities and opportunities, but historical points of interests.<br><br>
              
              Block groups are influenced in a way where there is division in terms of opportunity; unemployment,
              median income and partially on commute time and vehicle ownership among block groups. Both experienced similar effects
              regarding proximity to toxic release sites, bus stops, and community resources. Areas where there are high-opportunity
              block groups are also located near the Wissahickon Hills, Fox Chase – Burholme, and the airport.<br>
